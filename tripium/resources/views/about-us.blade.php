        <p>Tripium actually started in the hotel world. Our founders noticed there wasn’t a good way for guests in Branson, MO to buy tickets easily, so they built their own ticket company. Fast forward 25 years, and Tripium has grown into its own business, helping hotels, DMOs, shows, attractions, and tours create better vacation experiences.</p>
        <p>We also saw that visitors needed better restaurant info, so we created a leisure restaurant marketing division to fill that gap.</p>
        <p><strong>Our core values are simple:</strong> Integrity, Service, Teamwork, Innovation, and Dedication.</p>
        <p><strong>At the heart of what we do is a clear focus:</strong> making vacation experiences better.</p>
        <p><strong>And our sweet spot?</strong> Connecting visitors and travel suppliers with simple, smart solutions.</p>
